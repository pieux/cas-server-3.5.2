    <title>Planning and Deployment</title>

    <para>Planning a CAS deployment requires consideration of the application and
        platform ecosystem in light of security considerations, availability, and
        capacity.</para>

    <section>
        <title>System Integration</title>
        <para>
            Enterprise deployment planning begins with careful consideration of existing software and systems to be
            integrated with CAS including applications, identity management and authentication services, and other
            supporting enterprise services.

            <title>CAS Client Integration</title>
            <para>The following CAS clients can be employed to integrate most proprietary and
                open source applications:</para>

            <para>
                Additionally, custom applications developed in common languages/platforms are easily supported in most
                cases. In almost all cases Web applications are easily integrated with CAS. Difficulty commonly arises,
                however, with applications built on legacy frameworks such as database procedural languages (e.g. PL/SQL)
                or mainframe applications. These kinds of applications frequently require creative solutions for CAS
                integration, but there are many such examples in community-contributed integration solutions that
                showcase the flexibility of CAS.

            <title>Authentication</title>
            <para>CAS must be integrated with one or more enterprise authentication systems such as LDAP/Active Directory.
                While it is most common to integrate CAS with a single enterprise authentication system, it is possible to
                integrate with multiple systems given the following important requirement.</para>

            <caution>
                <title>Using Multiple Authentication Sources</title>
                <para>The namespaces of each authentication source must be guaranteed to be unique in order to prevent
                    ambiguity about the identity of the authenticating user. In particular neither a credential such as a
                    username nor the name of the resolved principal may exist in more than one authentication source.</para>
            </caution>

            <para>CAS supports many ways of authenticating user credentials, including:</para>

            <title>Attribute Release</title>
            <para>
                In addition to authenticating the user, CAS is capable of querying for additional attributes about a user
                following authentication in order to store and release some or all of this information to requesting
                services for the purposes such as authorization and personalization. Attribute data is commonly sourced
                from the same store as authentication data, but the design of attribute retrieval allows configuring
                multiple disparate attribute sources.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Supporting Services</title>
            <para>Many enterprises have services that may be leveraged by CAS. For example, the availability of enterprise
                database hosting might suggest the use of JpaTicketRegistry for the server ticket store. Likewise clustering
                hardware or software might be used by CAS for improved availability and/or capacity.</para>
